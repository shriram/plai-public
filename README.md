This is the public repository for the book [*Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation*](https://plai.org/) (PLAI). For now, it's being used only to create and track issue requests, though in future we may use it for more purposes. (The book source is private for now.)

To report a problem or make a suggestion, please use [one of these forms](https://github.com/shriram/plai-public/issues/new/choose) (borrowed with thanks from the [DCIC reporting repo](https://github.com/data-centric-computing/dcic-public)).
